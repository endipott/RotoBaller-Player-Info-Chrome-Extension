{"name":"FantasyGraph","tagline":"Helping you over-analyze you fantasy baseball team since 2012.","body":"### What is FantasyGraph?\r\nFantasyGraph is a Chrome browser extension that integrates FanGraphs and Baseball Reference directly into your fantasy baseball league website.\r\n\r\n### Do I need it?\r\nDo you play fantasy baseball?  Is your league site run on CBSSports.com or ESPN.com?  Do you often find your self unimpressed with the stats that those sites provide you?  Do you think xFIP has more predictive value then ERA?  If you answered yes to these questions, you probably spend a little to much time switching back and forth between your league website and more in depth baseball sites like FanGraphs or Baseball Reference.  This extension is designed to cut down on that wasted time.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\nFantasyGraph scans through your league's team clubhouse, free agency, and trade pages looking for player names.  Whenever a player is found, the extension inserts a link to that player's profile on FanGraphs and/or Baseball Reference (you can adjust the sites in the extension's setting).  You end up with a page that looks something like this: ![FantasyGraph Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/fOAY0Wc.jpg) Now looking up Mike Napoli's BABIP is as easy as clicking the little FanGraphs logo next to his name.\r\n\r\n### I'm sold, now how do I get it?\r\nFantasyGraph is available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fantasygraph/pghfoglbgdeknkjcmilhkidfdkgenfdi).","google":"UA-29318842-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
